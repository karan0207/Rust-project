Project Title: RustyTrader - A Stock Trading Algorithm
Overview
RustyTrader is a command-line application designed to analyze stock data and execute simulated trading strategies. Using Rust's performance and reliability, the application fetches historical stock prices, applies trading algorithms (like moving averages or momentum strategies), and reports profits or losses.

Features
Stock Data Integration:

Fetch historical data using an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Polygon.io).
Save data locally for offline analysis.
Trading Algorithms:

Moving Average Crossover: Simulates buy/sell signals when short-term moving averages cross long-term moving averages.
RSI (Relative Strength Index): Buys when RSI indicates oversold and sells when overbought.
Custom Algorithm Support: Allow users to implement and test their algorithms.
Performance Analysis:

Calculate total returns, win/loss ratio, and risk metrics.
Visualize trade history and profits using a library like plotters.
CLI Interface:

Provide users with interactive commands to select stock symbols, strategies, and parameters.
